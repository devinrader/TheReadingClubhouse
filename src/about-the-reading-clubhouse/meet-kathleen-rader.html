<p>About me….Kathleen Rader (aka The Book Lady)</p>
<p>In the summer of 2013, I was starting to homeschool my son, who was starting kindergarten, and had a newborn baby girl.  I went to a local homeschool event as I needed a specific Usborne book for my curriculum and I knew that they had a vendor there.  I was able to see so many books in person and wanted to buy so many of them.  Then, the consultant told me I could host a party to get them for FREE!  I was so excited as my wishlist was quite long after seeing so many in person.  So I invited my friends over and everyone LOVED the books!  The consultant then told me that there were no selling quotas and you could just buy books for a discount.  That is what this homeschooling momma on a budget wanted to hear! </p>
<p>So I joined and became a consultant….for the discount.</p>
<p>But of course, I received my box of books and started really looking at what I could do with this business opportunity in front of me and my previous corporate world turned SAHM mom brain got a little excited.  I didn’t know how much I needed this creative and fun outlet for myself.</p>
<p>I started doing events and parties and everything just kind of took off!  I was having fun and enjoying using this “side of my brain” again. But I also loved that I could work this around my family’s schedule.  I worked during naptimes and when the kids were in bed.  I don’t know any other job with this kind of flexibility.</p>
<p>I now have 3 wonderful kids who are growing up with a house full of incredible books.  I enjoy  doing events, parties, and working with schools and libraries to help them get our amazing books in the hands of so many children and families! </p>
