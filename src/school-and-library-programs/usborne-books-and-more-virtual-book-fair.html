Usborne Books & More Virtual Book Fairs

Virtual book fairs take place entirely online.  Parents shop from a special website which gives the school or organization credit for their order.  Teacher Wish Lists can be connected to the virtual fair for parents to support their child’s classroom directly.  Orders are typically shipped the next business day directly to the customer

Advantages of a Virtual Book Fair:

    No volunteers needed to staff the event
    Convenient 24/7 access to shopping website
    All 2,000+ titles are available for purchase
    No need to collect money or orders from students
    No counting or reconciling orders
    S/H is 8% min – a $100 order ships for $8
    Orders ship via UPS/UPS Sure Post
    No sorting or bagging books

Videos and social media images are provided for you to promote your Usborne Books & More Virtual Book Fair. As your Educational Services rep, I will provide masters of take-home flyers and posters for you to print for each student.
