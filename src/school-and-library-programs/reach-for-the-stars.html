<h1>Reach for the Stars!!</h1>
<p>The Reach for the Stars!! program rewards children for reading with free books of their choice as well as new books for their school or organization. Reach for the Stars!! returns a minimum of 100% back to the school and students in a combination of Usborne & Kane Miller books. A cash fundraiser option is also available.</p>
<h2>What is the goal of the program?</h2>
<p>The goal of Reach for the Stars!! is for children to develop a daily reading habit during the one to two week period of the RFTS program. Educational experts recommend that children read 30 minutes per weekday. This program offers a fun and rewarding way to develop that habit.</p>
<h2>Who can participate?</h2>
<p>This program is designed to benefit any organizational group such as schools, individual classrooms, clubs, pre-schools, church groups, home school groups, charities, businesses, and public libraries.</p>
<h2>Raising Pledges</h2>
<p>Parents and children request pledges from friends and family members to support the kids’ reading habit. Ask your organization if corporate sponsorships are available.</p>
<h2>How do the kids benefit?</h2>
<p>Kids develop a reading routine and receive Usborne & Kane Miller books for participating. Together we can help children discover the joy of reading and give them the opportunity to choose their very own books to keep!</p>
<h2>How does your organization benefit?</h2>
<p>Reach for the Stars!! has flexible options to meet your needs, whether you need books for the library, classroom, community projects, or perhaps cash for a specific purpose. A minimum of 100% of the pledges are returned to the participants and organization in the form of books, or a combination of books and cash with the fundraising option.</p>
