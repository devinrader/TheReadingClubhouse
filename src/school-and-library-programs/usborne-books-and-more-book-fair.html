Usborne Books & More Book Fair
Our Programs for Schools & Libraries

Additional programs available for schools and libraries to earn cash or books with Usborne Books & More
Fun, easy, and hassle free!

We understand the needs and challenges faced by organizations trying to raise funds, so we’ve designed a program to make it easy for you to reach your fundraising goals! For in-person book fairs, your Educational Services Representative will set up the book fair and tear it down. If your school does not have volunteers to staff it during the week, there are also options for the representative to staff the book fair.

For Virtual Book Fairs, your school or organization is given all of the tools and communication needed to run a smooth and successful online book fair. Click here to read more details on our Virtual Book Fairs
