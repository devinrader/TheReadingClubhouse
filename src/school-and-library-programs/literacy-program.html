<h1>Literacy Program</h1>

<p>Literacy for a Lifetime is a 50% grant matching program partnering Usborne Books & More with businesses, foundations, and individuals who support reading at organizations and schools of their choice. Reading is the heart of education! As the leading publisher of childrenâ€™s non-fiction books, Usborne Books & More carries over 1800 Usborne and Kane Miller titles, including fiction, story books, activity books and more, where reading is fun for kids of all ages. The Literacy for a Lifetime program matches any corporate or individual donation or grant that purchases books from Usborne Books & More with an additional 50% in free books. For example, when a corporation donates $10,000 in books from Usborne Books & More to a local elementary school, Usborne Books & More will donate an additional $5,000 in books to the school.</p>
