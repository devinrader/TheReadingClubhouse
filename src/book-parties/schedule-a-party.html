<h1>Usborne Books & More Party</h1>
<p>What is a book party?  A book party is a fun way to earn free and discounted books just for getting some friends together for some fun!  Most parties are online through either Facebook or another party platform called Sqweee.  As your consultant, I get the party set up and worry about the posting…you just need to invite your friends and family and have fun interacting with them during the party!</p>
<p>My book parties are very flexible.  Many people enjoy meeting at a specific time one night after the kids are in bed (usually around 8:30pm).  We meet for about 45 minutes and I share the books and your guests order!  Some people opt for a party that is over the course of a few days.  This allows people to check out the posts at their leisure during that party time-frame.  Both ways of partying results in YOU earning lots of books!  An average host receives around $300 in FREE and discounted books! Ready to schedule a party and earn some amazing free books?  Please fill out the form below and I will contact you with additional information.  There is no obligation or cost to schedule or host a party. Let’s get this party started!</p>
